**🧮 BMI Calculator using Python**

A beginner-friendly Python project that calculates the **Body Mass Index (BMI)** based on user inputs for height and weight, and classifies it as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese.

**📁 Features Implemented**

- 📥 Takes user input for weight (kg) and height (m)
- ➗ Calculates BMI using the formula: `BMI = weight / (height^2)`
- 🧾 Categorizes the result: Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese
- 🎯 Provides instant output

**🔧 Technologies & Libraries**

- `Python` built-in functions
- `input()`, `float()`, `if-elif` conditions
- No external libraries required

**🧠 Workflow**

1. User enters their weight and height.
2. BMI is calculated and rounded to 2 decimal places.
3. Output displays both BMI value and health category.
   
**📊 Output Example**
Enter your weight in kg: 60
Enter your height in meters: 1.65
Your BMI is: 22.04
