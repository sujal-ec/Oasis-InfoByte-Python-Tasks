# 🧮 BMI Calculator

## 📄 Overview
This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator built using Python’s `Tkinter` library.  
The application allows users to input their weight and height, calculates their BMI, and classifies it into categories such as **Underweight**, **Normal weight**, **Overweight**, or **Obesity**.

## ✨ Features
- User-friendly graphical interface (GUI) built with `Tkinter`.
- Input fields for weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
- Displays the calculated BMI and provides classification.
- Handles errors for invalid input (e.g., negative values or non-numeric inputs).
- Stores and prints historical BMI data for demonstration.
